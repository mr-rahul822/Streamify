# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses multiple API issues including 401 Unauthorized errors, 400 Bad Request errors, and malformed URLs. The issues stem from inconsistent credential handling, URL typos, and missing error handling in API requests, causing various authentication and request failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all authenticated API calls to consistently include credentials, so that authentication works reliably across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making any authenticated API request THEN the system SHALL include credentials (cookies) with the request
2. WHEN the getAuthUser function is called THEN the system SHALL send the authentication cookie to the backend
3. WHEN any protected route is accessed THEN the system SHALL receive the user's authentication token via cookies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist properly, so that I don't get unexpected 401 errors when navigating the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am logged in and refresh the page THEN the system SHALL maintain my authentication state
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL not lose my authentication status
3. IF my session expires THEN the system SHALL handle the 401 error gracefully and redirect to login

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API endpoints to have correct URLs and proper error handling, so that requests don't fail due to typos or malformed endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN all URLs SHALL be correctly formatted without typos
2. WHEN an API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL use the correct endpoint path
3. WHEN API calls fail due to URL errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling for all API failures, so that users get appropriate feedback when any issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call returns 401 Unauthorized THEN the system SHALL log the error appropriately
2. WHEN an API call returns 400 Bad Request THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to the user
4. WHEN a token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without breaking the application
