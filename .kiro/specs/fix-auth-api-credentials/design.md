# Design Document

## Overview

The authentication issue stems from inconsistent credential handling in the frontend API layer. While the axios instance is configured globally with `withCredentials: true`, some API functions override this behavior or don't properly inherit it. The solution involves ensuring all authenticated API calls consistently include credentials and implementing proper error handling for authentication failures.

## Architecture

The fix involves three main components:
1. **API Layer**: Ensure consistent credential inclusion across all authenticated endpoints
2. **Error Handling**: Implement centralized authentication error handling
3. **State Management**: Ensure authentication state remains consistent

## Components and Interfaces

### API Layer (`Frontend/src/lib/api.js`)
- **Current Issue**: `getAuthUser()` function doesn't explicitly include `withCredentials: true`
- **Solution**: Ensure all authenticated API calls consistently include credentials
- **Interface**: All functions that call protected endpoints should include credential configuration

### Axios Configuration (`Frontend/src/lib/axios.js`)
- **Current State**: Global `withCredentials: true` is set but may not be consistently applied
- **Enhancement**: Add request interceptor to ensure credentials are always included for authenticated requests
- **Interface**: Axios instance with consistent credential handling

### Authentication Hook (`Frontend/src/hooks/useAuthUser.js`)
- **Current State**: Uses React Query to manage auth state
- **Enhancement**: Add better error handling for 401 responses
- **Interface**: Hook that provides auth state and handles authentication errors

## Data Models

### Authentication State
```javascript
{
  user: {
    id: string,
    email: string,
    // other user properties
  },
  isLoading: boolean,
  error: string | null
}
```

### API Response Format
```javascript
{
  success: boolean,
  user?: object,
  message?: string
}
```

## Error Handling

### 401 Unauthorized Errors
1. **Detection**: Catch 401 responses in API calls
2. **Logging**: Log authentication errors with context
3. **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages
4. **State Management**: Clear authentication state on 401 errors

### Implementation Strategy
- Add axios response interceptor to handle 401 errors globally
- Ensure consistent error logging across all API functions
- Implement graceful degradation when authentication fails

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test that all authenticated API calls include credentials
- Test error handling for 401 responses
- Test authentication state management

### Integration Tests
- Test complete authentication flow (login → authenticated request → logout)
- Test session persistence across page refreshes
- Test handling of expired tokens

### Manual Testing
- Verify that `getAuthUser` no longer returns 401 errors
- Test authentication state persistence
- Verify error handling provides appropriate user feedback
